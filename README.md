# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds. This leads to a `Constraint_Error` exception.

The `bug.ada` file contains code that attempts to access an element beyond the array's size.  The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to prevent this error using proper index checks.
